Palette for "./cv ~/git/chowder/tests/r.0.0.mca 0,0,4" is wrong when comparing
it to the same chunk on "https://irath96.github.io/webNBT/".

When parsing palette entries, blockstates with properties get added to the
palette twice; once with the parsed properties, and one with the default values.

Ex. if it parses "minecraft:water;level=8", it'll add "minecraft:water;level=8"
AND "minecraft:water" to the palette.

This causes varying levels of fuckup depending on how early in the palette
an entry with properties appears. Palettes with blockstates that have no
properties aren't affected, which makes only some chunks look fucky.
